          Under bright Dubai sun of the STEP 2024 conference held on February
          21st and 22nd, an innovation stood out, promising to redefine the
          landscape of waste management and recycling. Known for IoT-powered
          Renie Bins that already have transformed recycling with transparency
          and efficiency, we unveiled our latest prototype: an AI and computer
          vision-enabled bin adept at recognizing not just water bottles, but
          now, plastic and paper cups as well!

          The Innovation Unveiled
        </h2>

        <p className="text-[18px] leading-[27px] font-[400]">
          This new feature is more than just an upgrade; it’s a revolution in
          recycling technology, with the potential to significantly increase
          recycling rates by accommodating a wider range of recyclable
          materials. The prototype uses advanced AI and computer vision to
          accurately identify and sort plastic and paper cups, a step that
          broadens the horizon for recycling possibilities.

          Technological Advancements
        </h2>

        <p className="text-[18px] leading-[27px] font-[400]">
          At the heart of this innovation is our commitment to in-house
          technological development, focusing on user-friendly and efficient
          solutions. “We aimed to make the recycling process as fast and
          comfortable as possible for the user,” explained the development team.
          With our new system, users can simply take a photo of their cup, and
          the bin’s sophisticated AI will recognize it, allowing for deposit and
          recycling within an astonishing 10 seconds. This seamless interaction
          is powered by a robust combination of AI, computer vision, and IoT,
          ensuring real-time data tracking and a smooth user experience.

          Market Impact and Future Plans
        </h2>

        <p className="text-[18px] leading-[27px] font-[400]">
          The response to the new prototype at STEP 2024 was overwhelmingly
          positive. Our CEO, Sander, shared, “We got a lot of positive feedback
          on the prototype and are looking forward to scaling it up.” The vision
          doesn’t stop at just enhancing the bins’ capabilities; it extends to
          making recycling accessible to everyone. “Our ultimate goal is to
          provide a recycling point within a 5-minute walk everywhere,” he
          added.

          Environmental and Social Benefits
        </h2>
        <p className="text-[18px] leading-[27px] font-[400]">
          By making recycling more accessible and rewarding—through Raffles
          within Renie App — we are set to significantly impact recycling rates
          positively. Moreover, the data collected from Renie Bins can be used
          for data monetization technology, offering invaluable insights into
          recycling trends and efficiencies for business. This, in turn,
          supports the global movement towards plastic and carbon offsetting,
          contributing to a more sustainable planet. The STEP 2024 conference
          served as a pivotal platform for us to showcase our continued
          innovation and dedication to making the world a better place. The
          introduction of our AI and computer vision-equipped Renie bins for
          plastic and paper cups marks a significant milestone in our recycling
          technology!
